# Walled Templates

This module lets you toggle measured templates so that they can be blocked by walls. For example, if in your game system, walls block *fireball*, you can use this module to determine the extent of the fireball given one or more walls. 

This could be used in combination with other modules or macros that automatically target tokens based on measured templates, such as [midi-qol](https://foundryvtt.com/packages/midi-qol/) or [DragonFlagon Quality of Life](https://foundryvtt.com/packages/df-qol).
